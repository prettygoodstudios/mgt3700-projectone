            <p>Operations managers use various methods and systems to solve business problems. Some of these methods and systems include Six Sigma, optimization algorithims, process maps and the Toyota Production System. Six Sigma the first item mentioned is a quality assurance system developed in the 1980s at Motorola that is commonly used by operations managers to identify sources of defects and address those sources. Six Sigma heavily relies on statistics. In addition, operations managers use optimization algorithims such as linear programming to solve resource allocation problems. Process maps also help operations managers to allocate resources efficiently. Process maps model processes by describing tasks as nodes and dependencies between tasks as edges. This visualizes the flow of the process. This visualization can help operations managers identify bottlenecks and mentally simulate processes. In addition, process maps can be a tool in designing new proceses. The last but not least item mentioned is the Toyota Production System. The Toyota Production System is a system that eliminates waste by reducing the amount of inventory present in a production system therefore decreasing WIP. These methods and systems help operations managers optimize the value provided by the operations conducted by a business.</p>
