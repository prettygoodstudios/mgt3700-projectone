            <p>You learned that a process is only as good as its weakest link. This is more formely referred to as Goldratt’s Theory of Constraints. Goldratt’s theory of constrainst states that all processes have a constraint and that processes can only be improved by alleviating the contraint. The contraint is typically just reffered to as the bottleneck in operations management. In the excercise you just conducted the optimal solution was achieved by designing the tasks in a way that minimized the duration of the longest task. This is in a sense alleviating the bottleneck. In addition, this excercise illustrates the power of operations management. You were able to increase production without changing the amount of resources used. This shows how good operations management can minimize costs and can optimize the allocation of a organizations resources.</p>
