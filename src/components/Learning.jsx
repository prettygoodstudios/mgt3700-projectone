            <p>You learned that a process is only as good as its weakest link. This is more formely referred to as Goldratt’s Theory of Constraints. Goldratt’s theory of constrainst states that all processes have a constraint and that processes can only be improved by alleviating the contraint. In the excercise you just conducted the optimal solutions was achieved by designing the tasks in a way that minimized the duration of the longest task.</p>
