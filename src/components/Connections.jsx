            <h1 className="section__header">How is operations management related to other fields?</h1>
            <p>After reading the previous section, you may be wondering what is the relationship of operations management to other fields. Many of the techniques and methods described earlier are borrowed from other fields. Operations management is a mutlidisciplinary field that heavily relies on other disciplines such as operations research, industrial engineering, statistics, math and computer science. Operations management differs from these fields as operations management takes in to consideration the human factors that effect processes. Humans are an important part of any proceess as the motivation, ability and decision making of workers has a major impact on the efficiency of processes. These factors lead to variablity in production and outcomes that may not align with mathematical, industrial engineering or operations research models. In additon, operations management takes into consideration the value provided by processes to consumers. Therefore, operations management is a distinct and necessary field.</p>
